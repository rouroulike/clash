# Welcome
Welcome to the official Wiki page of the Clash core project ("Clash"). There are currently two versions of Clash:
* Clash: the open-source software released at [Dreamacro/clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash)
* [Clash Premium](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases/tag/premium): proprietary Clash binary with [TUN support and more](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/wiki/Clash-Premium-Features) (zero of charge)

This wiki will cover both versions of Clash. 

> This documentation is still in the works. While we strive to improve it and keep it accurate,  
  we recommend reading https://lancellc.gitbook.io/clash as well.

# Getting Started
You can either grab the pre-built binaries of Clash from [https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases) or build locally.  

Clash requires Golang 1.19 or a higher version.

```
$ go install github.com/Dreamacro/clash@latest
```

The binary is built under $GOPATH/bin

```
$ clash -v
```

You can now move forward to [the next chapters of this wiki](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/wiki/configuration) in which we'll cover the configuration syntax of Clash.
