Welcome to the official knowledge base of the Clash core project ("Clash"). Clash is a rule-based proxy utility running on the network and application layer. Clash supports various proxy and anti-censorship protocols out-of-the-box.

There are currently two publicly distributed versions of Clash:

- Clash: the open-source software released at [github.com/Dreamacro/clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash)
- [Clash Premium](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases/tag/premium): proprietary core with [TUN support and more](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/wiki/Clash-Premium-Features) (free of charge)

This wiki covers both versions.
