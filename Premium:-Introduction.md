In the past, there was only one open-source version of Clash, until some improper use and distributions of Clash arose. From that, we decided to fork Clash and develop the more advanced features in a private GitHub repository.

Don't worry just yet - the Premium core will stay free of charge, and the security is enforced with code reviews from multiple credible developers.

For official descriptions of all releases, refer to [releases](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases/tag/premium) and click _History Release Note._
